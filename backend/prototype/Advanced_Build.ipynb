        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",

        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

So, the objectives of this study were to clarify how\\ninsomnia contributes to the decrease of muscular function and to investigate\\nthe mechanisms behind this phenomenon. Methods: To understand how insomnia\\ninfluence muscle function, we analyzed the expression level of factors\\nassociated with muscle protein degradation, muscle protein synthesis , protein\\nsynthesis and degradation pathways and muscle clock. Results: The results\\nshowed that lower BMI and grip strength were observed in insomnia patients. The\\nmice in the sleep deprivation(SD) group saw a 7.01 g loss in body mass. The SD\\ngroup's tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscle mass decreased after 96 h of\\nSD). The grip strength reduced in SD group. Using the RT-PCR approaches, we\\nfound a significant increase in muscle degradation factors expression in SD\\ngroup versus normal control group. Conclusions: Insomnia can impair muscle\\nfunction. The mechanism may be associated with the increased expression of\\nmuscle degradation related factors , as well as the abnormal expression of\\nClock gene.\\n\\nPublished: 2020-08-14\\nTitle: Large-Scale Analysis of Iliopsoas Muscle Volumes in the UK Biobank\\nAuthors: Julie Fitzpatrick, Nicolas Basty, Madeleine Cule, Yi Liu, Jimmy D. Bell, E. Louise Thomas, Brandon Whitcher\\nSummary: Psoas muscle measurements are frequently used as markers of sarcopenia and\\npredictors of health. Manually measured cross-sectional areas are most commonly\\nused, but there is a lack of consistency regarding the position of the\\nmeasurementand manual annotations are not practical for large population\\nstudies. We have developed a fully automated method to measure iliopsoas muscle\\nvolume (comprised of the psoas and iliacus muscles) using a convolutional\\nneural network. Magnetic resonance images were obtained from the UK Biobank for\\n5,000 male and female participants, balanced for age, gender and BMI.

Detecting errors in workout form naturally\\nrequires estimating human's body pose. However, off-the-shelf pose estimators\\nstruggle to perform well on the videos recorded in gym scenarios due to factors\\nsuch as camera angles, occlusion from gym equipment, illumination, and\\nclothing. To aggravate the problem, the errors to be detected in the workouts\\nare very subtle. To that end, we propose to learn exercise-oriented image and\\nvideo representations from unlabeled samples such that a small dataset\\nannotated by experts suffices for supervised error detection. In particular,\\nour domain knowledge-informed self-supervised approaches (pose contrastive\\nlearning and motion disentangling) exploit the harmonic motion of the exercise\\nactions, and capitalize on the large variances in camera angles, clothes, and\\nillumination to learn powerful representations. To facilitate our\\nself-supervised pretraining, and supervised finetuning, we curated a new\\nexercise dataset, \\\\emph{Fitness-AQA}\\n(\\\\url{https://github.com/ParitoshParmar/Fitness-AQA}), comprising of three\\nexercises: BackSquat, BarbellRow, and OverheadPress. It has been annotated by\\nexpert trainers for multiple crucial and typically occurring exercise errors.\\nExperimental results show that our self-supervised representations outperform\\noff-the-shelf 2D- and 3D-pose estimators and several other baselines. We also\\nshow that our approaches can be applied to other domains/tasks such as pose\\nestimation and dive quality assessment.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-10\\nTitle: Video-based Exercise Classification and Activated Muscle Group Prediction with Hybrid X3D-SlowFast Network\\nAuthors: Manvik Pasula, Pramit Saha\\nSummary: This paper introduces a simple yet effective strategy for exercise\\nclassification and muscle group activation prediction (MGAP).

            "[AIMessage(content=\"The research on the iliacus muscle indicates that it plays a significant role in the body's musculoskeletal and functional health. The iliacus, along with the psoas major, forms the iliopsoas group, which is crucial for hip flexion, stabilization, and movement. Studies have shown that the volume and health of the iliopsoas muscle are related to overall physical health, age, and activity levels. For example, decreased iliopsoas volume is associated with aging and sarcopenia, and maintaining its strength can be important for mobility and preventing injuries.\\n\\nRegarding the impact on the body, a tight or weak iliacus can contribute to various issues such as lower back pain, hip dysfunction, and altered gait patterns. Insomnia and other factors that impair muscle function can lead to increased muscle degradation, which may affect the iliacus among other muscles, impacting overall mobility and stability.\\n\\nAs for workout plans, targeted exercises can help strengthen and maintain the flexibility of the iliacus muscle. Here is a suggested workout plan:\\n\\n### Workout Plan to Strengthen and Flexibilize the Iliacus Muscle\\n\\n**Warm-up (5-10 minutes)**\\n- Light cardio (walking, cycling)\\n- Dynamic stretches (leg swings, hip circles)\\n\\n**Main Exercises**\\n1. **Hip Flexor Stretch**\\n   - Kneel on one knee, other foot in front, and gently push hips forward.\\n   - Hold for 30 seconds each side.\\n2. **Leg Raises**\\n   - Lie on your back, lift one leg straight up while keeping the other on the ground.\\n   - Perform 3 sets of 10 reps per leg.\\n3. **Standing Hip Flexion**\\n   - Stand upright, lift one knee towards your chest, hold for a second, then lower.\\n   - Perform 3 sets of 12 reps per leg.\\n4. **Lunge with Hip Flexor Stretch**\\n   - Step forward into a lunge position, gently push hips downward.\\n   - Hold for 30 seconds each side.\\n5. **Bridge with Knee Drive**\\n   - Lie on your back, lift hips, then bring one knee towards your chest.\\n   - Perform 3 sets of 12 reps per leg.\\n6. **Core Engagement Exercises**\\n   - Planks, side planks, and leg lifts to support hip stability.\\n\\n**Cool-down (5 minutes)**\\n- Gentle stretching focusing on hip flexors and hamstrings.\\n\\n**Additional Tips**\\n- Maintain proper posture during exercises.\\n- Incorporate flexibility training regularly.\\n- Consult a physical therapist for personalized guidance, especially if experiencing pain or dysfunction.\\n\\nWould you like more detailed instructions or variations for these exercises?\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 537, 'prompt_tokens': 2120, 'total_tokens': 2657, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-BuNdmTGYB7AzUElAsvJ08QVfk2vDa', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--1ba50e06-9226-4f21-9e46-650f7ab8a386-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2120, 'output_tokens': 537, 'total_tokens': 2657, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]\n",
